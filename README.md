Project Name: MyFunUi

Description:
MyFunUi is a playful and interactive web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The core functionality includes a simple login form where users can enter their username and password. The unique feature of this UI is the behavior of the Submit button—if either the username or password field is left empty, the button humorously dodges the user’s pointer when hovered over. This adds an engaging and fun experience while subtly encouraging users to fill out the required fields.

Key Features:
	•	Interactive Design: The Submit button moves dynamically (left and right) if the form fields are incomplete.
	•	Responsive Layout: Ensures a seamless experience across devices and screen sizes.
	•	Clean and Minimalistic Interface: Styled with modern design principles using CSS animations and responsive layouts.
	•	User Feedback: Displays tooltips to guide users to fill out the necessary fields.

Tech Stack:
	•	HTML: For structuring the form and UI elements.
	•	CSS: For styling, including hover effects, animations, and responsive design.
	•	JavaScript: For interactivity, including button movement and form validation logic.

Purpose:
This project demonstrates the use of basic web development technologies to create a fun and user-friendly application while showcasing creativity and problem-solving skills.
